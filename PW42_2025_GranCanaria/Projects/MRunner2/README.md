# Project Description

MHub.ai provides a collection of dockerized, DICOM compatible AI models. 
We will provide a new extension for 3D Slicer that allows to run models from MHub.ai directly from within 3D Slicer.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Describe **what you plan to achieve** in 1-2 sentences.

- [x] Run the default workflow (dicom-dicom) of MHub.ai models
- [x] Add generated DICOMSEG files to the 3D Slicer DICOM store
- [x] Conenct to the MHub.ai API to provide a list of available models
- [x] ~~Provide alternative backends (e.g., udocker)~~
- [x] ~~Run models on a remote server (via ssh)~~
- [ ] Implement a model search 
- [ ] Provide additional model information
- [ ] Support for non-segmentation models (using the 3D Slicer table view or DICOM SR)
